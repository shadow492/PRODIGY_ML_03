This project showcases a SVM classifier used to classify the images of cats and dogs. SVM stands for support vector machine and is a machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification and regression task of small to medium sized data sets which have complex relationships. This model is trained over 8K-10K images of cats and dogs.
